//DOOR RULES:
//1: An open door can be closed
//2: A closed (but not locked) door can be opened
//3: A closed door can be locked
//4: A locked door can be unlocked, but numeric password is needed and will only unlock if the code provided matches the door's current passcode
//5: When a door is created, it must be given an initial passcode
//6: You should be able to change the passcode by supplying the current code and a new one. It should only change if the correct current code is given

//OBJECTIVES
//Define a Door class that can keep track of whether it is locked, open or closed
//Create methods to perform the four transitions defined above
//Build a constructor that requires the starting numeric passcode
//Build a method that will allow you to change the passcode for an existing door by supplying the current passcode and a new passcode. Only change the passcode is
//the current one is correct
//Make your Main method ask the user for a starting passcode, then create a new Door instance. Allow the user to attemp the four transitions (open, close, lock, unlock)
//and change the code by typing in text commands
