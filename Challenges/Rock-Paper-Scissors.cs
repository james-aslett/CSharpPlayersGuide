//Provide an object-oriented design (a set of objects, classes and how they interact) for the game Rock, Paper Scissors described below:
//two human players compete against each other
//each player picks Rock, Paper or Scissors
//depending on the player's choices, a winner is determined: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock. If both players pick the same it is a draw
//the game must display who won the round
//the game will keep running rounds until the window is closed, but must remember the historical records of how many times each player won and how many times there
//was a draw
//OBJECTIVES
//use CRC cards (or a suitable alternative) to outline the objects and classes that may be needed to make the game. You do NOT need to create the game, just come
//up with a potential design as a starting point
