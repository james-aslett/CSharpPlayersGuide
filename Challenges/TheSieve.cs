//Create a Sieve class with a public bool IsGood(int number) method. This class needs a constructor with a delegate parameter that can be invoked later within the IsGood method. Hint: You can make your own delegate type or use Func<int, bool>

//Define methods with an int parameter and a bool return type for the following:
    //1: returns true for even numbers
    //2: returns true for positive numbers
    //3: returns true for multiples of 10

//Create a program that asks the user to pick one of those three filters, constructs a new Sieve instance by passing in one of thoses methods as a parameter, and then ask the user to enter numbers repeatedly, displaying whether the number is good or bad depending on the filter in use

//Answer this question: Describe how you could have solved this problem with inheritance and polymorphism. Which solution seems more straightforward to you, and why?
