#1 Do I share the project or not?

#2 Should this individual type definition be shared or not?

#3 Should this member (a field or a method) be shared or not?

Questions to ask of a class:
- If this thing's container were usable anywhere, how available should this specific item be?
- If this project was avaiable to anybody, would I want them to be able to reuse this class? Or is this a secret detail that I want to reserve the right to change without
affecting anybody?

Questions to ask of a method:
- If this class were public, would I want this method to be public, or is this something that I want to be less accessible so that I can change it more easily later?

TIP: Always write out accessibility level rather than rely on the default, as it'll get you into the habit of thinking about it. If you feel you prefer using the defaults
after a few months then you can revert to those once you fully understand the rammifications
