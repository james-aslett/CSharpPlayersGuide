//THE STRINGBUILDER CLASS
//One problem with doing lots of operations with strings is that it has to duplicate all of the string contents in memory for every modification. Consider this code:
string text = "";
while (true)
{
    string? input = Console.ReadLine();
    if (input == null || input == "") break;
    text += input;
    text += ' ';
}
Console.WriteLine(text);

//In this code, we keep creating new strings that are longer and longer. The user enters "abc" and this code creates a string containing "abc". It then immediately makes another string with the text "abc  ". Then the user enters "def", and your program will make another string containing "abc deff" and then another containing "abc def  ". These partial strings could get long, take up a lot of memory, and make the garbage collector work hard.

//An alternative is the StringBuilder class in the System.Text namespace. System.Text is not one of the namespaces we get automatic access to, so the code below includes the System.Text namespace when referencing StringBuilder. (We'll address that in more depth in Level 33.) This class hangs on to fragments of strings and does not assemble them into the final string until it is done. It will get a reference to the string "abc" and "def", but won't make any temporary combined strings until you ask for it with the ToString() method:
System.Text.StringBuilder text2 = new System.Text.StringBuilder();
while (true)
{
    string? input = Console.ReadLine();
    if (input == null || input == "") break;
    text2.Append(input);
    text2.Append(' ');
}
Console.WriteLine(text2.ToString()); ;

//StringBuilder is an optimization to use when necessary, not something to do all the time. A few extra relatively short strings won't hurt anything. But if you are doing anything intensive, StringBuilder may be an easy substitute to help keep memory usage in check.
